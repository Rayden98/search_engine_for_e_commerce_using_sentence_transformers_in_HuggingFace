# Search Engine for E-Commerce using Sentence Transformers

This repository implements an **AI-powered semantic search engine for e-commerce** using **sentence transformers** from Hugging Face. The project enhances traditional keyword-based searches by **understanding user queries in natural language** and retrieving the most relevant product matches.

## Features
✅ **Dataset Preparation** – Processes large-scale product catalogs and generates embeddings for efficient search.  
✅ **Sentence Transformers for Semantic Search** – Utilizes **pre-trained transformer models** to convert text queries into vector representations.  
✅ **Efficient Embedding Search** – Implements **FAISS** or **Annoy** for fast, scalable similarity searches.  
✅ **Preprocessing & Data Augmentation** – Cleans and structures product descriptions for optimized search retrieval.  
✅ **Model Fine-Tuning** – Enhances search accuracy by fine-tuning Hugging Face transformers on domain-specific data.  
✅ **Vector Indexing for Fast Retrieval** – Uses approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques for quick response times.  
✅ **Real-Time Query Processing** – Allows users to input search queries and retrieve the most relevant e-commerce products instantly.  

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository** – Download the project and install dependencies.
2. **Prepare the Dataset** – Process and generate embeddings for the product catalog.
3. **Train & Fine-Tune the Model** – Fine-tune **sentence transformers** for domain-specific search.
4. **Run the Search Engine** – Input text queries and retrieve **semantic search results** based on embeddings.
5. **Deploy the Model** – Use FAISS or Annoy for efficient search indexing and real-time query processing.

## Technologies Used
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for sentence embeddings.
- **FAISS / Annoy** for efficient vector search and retrieval.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for fine-tuning transformers.
- **Flask / FastAPI** (optional) for serving search queries via REST APIs.
